Dear Author, 
<p>
Artifact evaluation and use have been of increasing importance and focus in recent years. 
We are conducting a study into how artifacts are being used in software engineering. 
We have identified your paper as possibly re-using artifacts from other research papers. 
This is commendable and an important part of open science! 
However, we wish to ensure we are correctly identifying the nature of the reuse in your paper. 
We would appreciate a response by **Aug 20, 2021**. 
And please note that we only ask that one of the authors of the paper respond to this survey request. 

<p>In the following table, we list your paper’s citation to another paper, that paper’s DOI, 
and our assessment of what sort of re-use we identified. Feel free to add clarification for each re-use.
